IAM
Identiy Access Management 101

IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console. It is important to understand
IAM and how it works, both for the exam and for administrating a compnay's AWS account in real life. 

(Maybe under Security Identity and Compliance)

What does IAM give you?
Centralised control of your AWS account 
Shared Access to your AWS account
Granular Permissions - restrict system admin and database owners from accessing user data
Identity Federation (including active directory, Facebook, Linkedin etc) you can connect your IAM into 
active directory, with FB Linkdin etc.. you can federate with those providers, allows you to access your
AWS Cloud resources centrally, use IAM to enable users to sign in to their AWS account with their
existing corporate credentials. 

Multifactor Authentication, use two-factor authentication
Provide temoprary access for users/devices and services where necessary 
Ex, if making app or mobile phone app, that application can temp access your account and store stuff
in Dynamo, 
Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy 
Integrates with many different AWS services
Supports PCI DSS Compliance - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard

CRITICAL TERMS 
Users - End Users (think people)
Groups - A collections of users under one set of permissions (groups users together and apply permission
to that specified group, ex, finance group, system adminstrator group)
Roles - You create roles and can then assing them to AWS resources, 

Example - Create Roles and assign to AWS resources, have EC2 instance (virtual machine) give the role 
in order to access S3, then that EC2 instance can write files directly to S3, and don't need to set up user 
and password for that EC2 instance, (next lab)

Policies - Documents that defines one or more permissions, attatch to users groups and roles, all connect
can all share policy document, 

LET'S GET STARTED

ON EXAM 
IAM is Global, it can be accessed from anywhere in the world, 

Go to user_name and then account, to get the IAM users sign-in link, we can customize it though, 
it is a new DNS name space, 

Security status, 5 different ticks are available, - Delete your root access keys is already checked,

What have we learned so far?
- IAM consist of the following 
Users
Groups - way to group users together and apply policies to them collectivly 
Roles
Policy Documents - apply to users gorup ands roles universally 
make up of JSON key value pair, attribute and value 
javascript object model 

IAM is universal, not apply to regions, 
the root account is the account created when you setupr your AWS account, have to give permissions 
New users have NO permissions when first created 
new users are assinged access key id and secret access keys when first created 
these are not the same as password, cannout use the access key id and secret to login to console
you can use to access AWS via the APIs and CLI 
once get save, wont get again 
always setup multfacor authenticaooon on your root account, -- google authentiocaon 
you can create and customise your own password and rotation policies
