EC2
ECC
Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud - virtual machine in cloud, only take minutes to get going
resizable, quickly scale up and down, as your computing requirements change 
use to take 10 days to months to get servers, now takes minutes, amazon led this industry change 

can add more and more instances behind elactic load balancer, pay for capacity you use, use to have to buy 
servers and over provision, pay for what you need as you use it, amazing, pay by the hour or by the second, 

EC2 Options, 
On Demand: pay fixed rate by hour or second with no commitment; linux by second windows by hour, 

Reserved Instances: capacity reservation, 1 to three years, discount and you pay for year long terms 

Spot - enables to bid a price, for instance capacity, give lots of savings if you get the price, 
if your app has flexible start and end times this is a good option, but the share when it drops, for a sale when it 
goes over a certain amount 

Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use, dedicated hosts can help you reduce costs 

----- 

Use cases for pricing models 
On Demand : Low cost and flexibility of amaozon EC2 without up fron payment or long term commitemnt, 

Application being developer or tested on Amaazon EC2

Reserved Instances: an actual web service, up front payment to reduce computing costs, pay all up front for 
3 year contract get a great discount, 
Standard RIs can be up to 75% off on demand costs, 
Convertible RIs 54% off, can change your reservations, go from CPU intensive to memory intensive instance, 
not locked into an instance time, 

Scheudlued Reserved Instances : launched in a time window, recurring schedule, fraction of day or month, 
scale from on demand scale back 

Spot instances: flexible start and end times, applictions feasible at very low compute prices 
do huge amount of compute at 4 am on a sunday morining, its spoty, bang, 
users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity 

Dedicated Hosts: regulatory requirments that may not supor t multi-tenant virtualization, could expose data 
to someone else, ??
great for licesning 
can be purchased on demand hourly 
puurcahses as reservation for 70% off

EC2 Instance Types -- dont need to memorize going into associate exams, useful at professional lvl, 
F1 - data analytics   --- LETTER FOR EXAM 
I3 - databases
G3 - video encoding 
H1 - file systems 
T2 - web serves small databases
D2 - data warehousing 
R4 - ram memory intensive 
M5- general purpose application servers 
C5 compute optimized - cpu intensive apps and databases 
P3 - general purpose GPUS machine learning, bit coing mining 
X1 - huge amoutns of RAM, apache spark, SAP HANA 

Imagine Edwards Notrton fighting Dr Mc Px, a scotting duck who likes to hand out pictures of scotland, 
F - FPGA
I - IOPS
G - Graphics
H - High Disk Throughput
T - cheap general purpose (think T2 Micro)
D - Density 
R - RAM
M - main choice for general purpose apps
C - Compute
P - Graphics (think Pics)
X - Extreme Memory

WHAT IS EBS?
EC2 virtual servier in cloud, EBS is ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE it is a virtual disc, 
create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances, placed in AZ and replicated to protect from failure, 
spread across AZ, EBS will be fine if one disc dies, EBS is disc in cloud that coonects to EC2 instance, 
windows installed on C:drive, but can have other drives, 
EBS 
genreal purpose SSD (GP2)
general puspose balances both price and performance, Input Output Operations Per Second
EXAM - less the 10,00 IOPS, then you want GP2 EXAM 
Provisioned IOPS SSD - instensive applications RDMS, NOSQL , need extreme performace, if you need more than 
10,000 IOPS , big SQL, go PROVISIONS IOPS SSD, provision 20000 IOPS per volume, 

EBS volumes, throughtput optimized disc is additional volume not boot volume 
big data, data warehouse, long procssing 

Magnetic Standar
lowest cost mangetic bootable volume, legacy, lowest storage cost is important, 

EC2 EXAM TIPS
- ON DEMAND - fix rate by the hour or by the second with no commitment 
- RESERVED - capacity reservation, offer significant discount on hourly charge for an 
insatance   1 Year of 3 Year terms 
- SPOT - bid a price, for instance capacity, great savings if your app have flexible start and 
end times, pay only for what you bid on, prolly charged by the hour 
- DEDICATED HOSTS - physical EC2 server dedicated for your use, help you reduce cost
by allowing you to use existing server-bound software license 

is SPOT instance is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for partial hour of usage, 
howver, if you temrinate the instance yourself you will be chaged for the time it ran 
POPULAR EXAM QUESTION ABOVE 
remember FIGHT DR MC PX

EXAM 

SSD - GENERAL PURPOSE SSD - balanc price and performance for wide workloads
Provisioned IOPS SSD - Highest performance SSD volume for mision-critical low-latency 
or high-throughput workloads

Magnetic
Throughoutput Optimized HDD - low cost HDD volume designed for frequenctly accessed 
thoughput intenisve workload 

A defined workload can be specified as a benchmark when evaluating a computer system 
in terms of performance (how easily the computer handles the workload), which in turn is 
generally divided into response time (the time between a user request and a response to 
the request from the system) and throughput (how much work is accomplished over a 
period of time).

COLD HDD - lowest cost HDD volume for less frequently accessed workload
Magnetic - Legacy, boot volume
