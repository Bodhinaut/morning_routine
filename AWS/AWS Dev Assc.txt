Look into getting a Raspberry Pi and making an alexa? 

Service and arcitechture, develop deploy and debug


Partner Program

Standard advanced and Premier, need two employees at associate level and 4 at professional
level, big demand for certs, increase your salary by 26% 

Devops Professional -> Certified Developer Associate , start with dev assc in the associate 
tier, can go into devops professinal after potentially, 

Sysops Administrator is hardest of assocaite exams, 

Solutions archietect professinal is hardest for profesional exams, 

Gonna learn alexa, some other servelet websites, poly service, 
need AWS free tier, need domain name,

there is a knowledge overlap between soultions architect and developer associate 

this course teaches you how to pass the exam not to learn how to code, 
so many avaiable SDK's, Software Develoement Kit, devkit, provides set of tools, libraries, 
and relevent documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that allow developers to 
create software applications on a specific platform, 

his questions will be, how to optomize to work better with your aps? etc.. 

Windows, will use putty to connect to AWS, 
NEED AWS Free Tier, 

Objective and things to know for AWS Exam, The Exam Blueprint

an AWS region consists of an independent collection of aws computing resources in a defined geography

these are all on AWS and more ^^ lots of services etc...  this is the 10,000 foot overview, 

region and availablity zone, 
region, tokyo, london... then availabity zone is a data center, if there is flooding, they can survive
etc.. 
availiability zone is place to put your resources, region is a geographical area, 

secret region for intellgicen services woww....

edge location for caching, endpoints for AWS, cloudfront, amazons content elivery network, 
once first person pulls down, will be cached close to them, pull from that edge location, more

EXAM TIPS SUMMARY

Availability Zones - distinct location within a geographic area designed to provide high awailabiliyt 
to a specifi geogrphy , disctince locations in AWS regions engineered to be isolated from failuers 

an AWS region consists of an independent collection of aws computing resources in a defined geography

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud is a networking service 

object based file storage is Simple Storage Serives S3

Route53 highly scable DNS service, named after port 53 where DNS resides 

Currenlyt there are 16 AWS regions worldwide and 42 availvibity zones, 

AWS  Elastic Map Reduce allows organizations to do complex analysis on large volumes of data.

Region, availability zone (az) and edge location
- region is a physical location in the world, has two or more AZ's, always at least 2
- an AZ is one ore more discrete data centers, each has redundant power networking and 
connectiity, houses in sepearte facilities, 
- edge locations are endpoints for AWS, whic are used for caching content, typically consists of 
CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN)
