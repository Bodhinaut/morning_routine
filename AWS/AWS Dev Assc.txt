there is a knowledge overlap between soultions architect and developer associate 

this course teaches you how to pass the exam not to learn how to code, 
so many avaiable SDK's, Software Develoement Kit, devkit, provides set of tools, libraries, 
and relevent documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that allow developers to 
create software applications on a specific platform, 

his questions will be, how to optomize to work better with your aps? etc.. 

Windows, will use putty to connect to AWS, 
NEED AWS Free Tier,

these are all on AWS and more ^^ lots of services etc...  this is the 10,000 foot overview, 

region and availablity zone, 
region, tokyo, london... then availabity zone is a data center, if there is flooding, they can survive
etc.. 
availiability zone is place to put your resources, region is a geographical area, 

secret region for intellgicen services woww....

edge location for caching, endpoints for AWS, cloudfront, amazons content elivery network, 
once first person pulls down, will be cached close to them, pull from that edge location, more 
edge locations than regions 

---------------------------------------------------
EXAM TIPS SUMMARY

Region, availability zone (az) and edge location
- region is a physical location in the world, has two or more AZ's, always at least 2
- an AZ is one ore more discrete data centers, each has redundant power networking and 
connectiity, houses in sepearte facilities, 
- edge locations are endpoints for AWS, whic are used for caching content, typically consists of 
CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN) 

-----------------------------------------------------

Parts and individual services, 
elastic Beanstalk, for those who want to deploy but don't understand AWS, 
EC2 first cloud computing, 
lambda favorite upload code then execute, no operating, systems, just upload your code, 
we will learn how to deploy with Lambda, 
Lightsail virtual private service, more for people who dont want to know AWS, water downed
verison of EC2, 
batch is for batch computing in the cloud, 
s3 oldest storage service, object based storage, 
efs elastic file system, 
glacier archive off of your data
snowball bring in large amounts of data without using broadband or wifi, 
then sent to aws and imported manually 
storage gateway virtaul replicate info back to s3, 
database, 
RDS - MYSQL POSTGREESS ETC... they have aurora, any relatiosnal database will sit here,
