MySQL
What is a databse?
1. A collection of data
2. A method for accessing and manipulating that data
Why do they matter?

What is a databse? - 1. A collection of data, files, a phone book, f_name l_name phone_book

find ned flanders, easy, find all people named ned, hard, this is why databases are importanant, 

2. A method for accessing and manipulating that data

Database vs Database Management System RDMS DMS etc.. 
Data and have an interface are 2 different things, 

you have your app, you have a database, WE talk to the DBMS, it talks to the database, 
it is the communication between our application and our database, 

What is a Database?
A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface

MySQL vs SQL

Structred Query Language 
SQL is the language we use to 'talk' to our databse, find all users, find all who are 18 etc..
delete, add etc.. these are queires, talks to our database for us, 
SELECT ....... this is a query!

MySQL is a RDMS, we are writing with SQL, 
SQL looks the same in MySQL and PostgreSQL

There are slight syntax differences, but there is a standard, SQL standard, they have to implmnt

Once you learn SQL, easy to switch around, 
DBMS are unique for the feautres they offer, not at their core, secuirty, swiftness and permissions 
change, but not the core, 

MySQL is a DBMS that implement the SQL (strucutred query language)
