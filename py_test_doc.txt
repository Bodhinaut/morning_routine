unittest
nose
pytest

the three types of testing in python 

first you need to install pytest, use pip, 

pip install pytest

must have test_ prefix befroe each unittest, 

so have your function, import the module into the pytest file, 

def test_whatever_total():
	total = imported.function(5,5)
	assert total == 9


then run py.test in command in that folder, 

py file, function names, all need test_ 


two ways to execute, 

python -m pytest

also, can do py.test
